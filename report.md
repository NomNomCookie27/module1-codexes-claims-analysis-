# Analysis of Medical Codes within Synthetic Medicare Fee-for-Service Claims Data

## Steps Taken During My Analysis
git
### 1. Loading the Data:
- I started by loading the ‘inpatient’ Medicare fee-for-service claims dataset into a Pandas . To ensure everything was in order, I checked the first few rows to confirm the data loaded correctly.

### 2. Finding the Code Columns:
- Next, I looked for columns related to medical codes by scanning for keywords like ‘code’, ‘icd’, ‘drg’, ‘hcpcs’, ‘procedure’, and ‘diagnosis’. This helped me zero in on the relevant data needed for the analysis.

### 3. Analyzing Code Frequencies:
- For each code column I identified, I calculated how often each unique code appeared. This was useful for understanding which codes were most common in the dataset.

### 4. Handling Missing Values:
- I checked the code columns for any missing values and filled them with ‘Unknown’. This step was important to keep the data consistent and complete for the analysis.

### 5. Looking at Regional Patterns:
- I wanted to find out if the frequency of code usage varies across different regions, so I grouped the data by any region-related columns I could find (like ‘region’ or ‘state’). Since the dataset was large, I used a 40% sample to keep the analysis manageable and avoid memory issues.

## Why Each Part of the Analysis Matters

- **Loading and Initial Checks**: This helped me confirm the data was loaded correctly and that I was working with the right structure.
- **Finding Code Columns**: It allowed me to focus on the data that mattered most for the analysis.
- **Code Frequency Analysis**: Summarizing the most common codes gave me a clear picture of the frequent diagnoses and procedures in the dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filling in the gaps ensured that missing data didn’t mess up my results.
- **Regional Analysis**: This part was about uncovering any patterns that might suggest regional differences in healthcare practices or needs.

## Key Findings

- **Common Codes**:
  - The analysis showed which ICD, DRG, and HCPCS codes were used most often. This aligns with common inpatient conditions and procedures, which was expected.
  
- **Regional Patterns**:
  - I found that certain codes popped up more frequently in specific regions, which could point to differences in health challenges or demographics by area. For example, some chronic condition codes were more common in particular states.

## Challenges I Faced and How I Solved Them

### 1. Column Parsing Issue:
- Initially, all the data ended up squished into one column because the delimiter was wrong.
- **Fix**: I reloaded the data using `|` as the delimiter, and that straightened everything out.

### 2. Mixed Data Types:
- Some columns had a mix of numbers and text, which caused warnings and made it tricky to work with the data.
- **Fix**: I used `low_memory=False` while loading the data and manually set the troublesome columns to strings to keep things consistent.

### 3. Memory Issues During Regional Analysis:
- When I first tried to analyze regional patterns with the full dataset, it caused memory errors.
- **Fix**: I used a 40% sample of the data, which was still enough to spot patterns without overwhelming the system.

## Reflections on the Implications

- **For Healthcare Providers**:
  - Knowing which codes are most common can help providers align their services with patient needs and be better prepared for what’s most prevalent.
  - The regional insights can also guide providers to tailor their services based on local health trends.

- **For Policymakers**:
  - These findings could help shape healthcare policies by highlighting regional disparities and guiding resource allocation to areas that need it most.
  - Policymakers can use this data to support targeted interventions and improve healthcare equity across different regions.

## Final Thoughts

Going through this analysis gave me a solid understanding of the common medical codes in Medicare claims and highlighted some interesting regional differences. It’s clear that these insights can be valuable for both healthcare providers and policymakers looking to optimize care and address regional health needs effectively.
